            necessity to preserve his life or enable one of his body parts to perform its function 
            properly so that the patient can carry out his role in society or work and support his
             family to protect it from collapse.

         <p> Nursery_:</p>
         <p> 8-12% of newborns in Egypt are born prematurely, 
            and this is a global percentage and does not concern Egypt only.
             Due to the severe shortage and unfair distribution of children's nurseries in hospitals 
             and the high cost of detaining newborn babies, the Egyptian Al-Shifa Bank established a program
              to equip children's nurseries and work to increase them in hospitals.</p>
